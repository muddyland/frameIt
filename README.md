# frameIt

FrameIt is a simple Python Flask application which displays Movie posters

This code was written as part of a DYI project of mine, and it meant to be used in a very specific way

I am putting this here in case it is useful for others to do the same. 

The code is MIT licensed, I do not care what you do with it. 

More to come as far as install docs and such, I am simply putting this here to have a place to work on it.
